*Pinboards are now Liveboards!*

Effective from the ThoughtSpot 8.4.1-sw release, ThoughtSpot pinboards are rebranded as Liveboards in ThoughtSpot UI, documentation, and learning resources.
Note that the `pinboard` and `PINBOARD_ANSWER_BOOK` terminology in REST API v1 endpoint URLs and request and response workflows are not rebranded.
