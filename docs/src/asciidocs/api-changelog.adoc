The `prefetch` API fetches static resources from a given URL before your application loads. Web browsers can then cache the prefetched resources locally and serve them from a user's local disk. You can use this API to load the embedded objects faster and improve your application response time.

For more information, see xref:prefetch-and-cache.adoc[Prefetch static resources].

|[tag greenBackground]#NEW FEATURE# a|+++<h5>+++In-app page navigation+++</h5>+++

The `navigateToPage` method in the SDK lets you provide quick and direct access to a specific pinboard, saved answer, or an application page.

+
When set to `true`, it executes search and shows the search results.

For more information, see xref:embed-search.adoc#search-query[Embed ThoughtSpot search].

|[tag redBackground]#DEPRECATED# a| +++<h5>searchQuery</h5>+++
