To provide quick access to a related report or saved answer within the context of an embedded Liveboard or visualization, you might want to add a custom action that navigates your users to a specific page in your app.

The Visual Embed SDK simplifies this process by allowing you to define a URL path in the `navigateToPage` function and assign it to an action or button event in the UI.

To add a custom action for in-app navigation, follow these steps:

. Make sure you have embedded the full ThoughtSpot app in your application. The `navigateToPage` API is available only with the `AppEmbed` package.
. xref:custom-actions-callback.adoc[Add a custom action].
. Register the callback in the Visual Embed SDK
. Define the page path 
 
In this example, the **view-report ** action on a Liveboard page calls the `navigateTo` method to open a specific saved answer page when a user clicks the **View report** button in the embedded app.

[source,javascript]
----
appEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.CustomAction, async (payload: any) => {
    if (payload.payload.id === 'view-report') {
        appEmbed.navigateToPage(
            'saved-answer/3da14030-11e4-42b2-8e56-5ee042a8de9e'
        );
    }
})
----

If you want to navigate to a specific application page without initiating a reload, you can set the `noReload` attribute to `true` as shown here:

[source,javascript]
----
appEmbed.on(EmbedEvent.CustomAction, async (payload: any) => {
    if (payload.payload.id === 'view-report') {
        appEmbed.navigateToPage('saved-answer/3da14030-11e4-42b2-8e56-5ee042a8de9e', true);
    }
})
