:page-description: This article sumamrizes the embedding support and ThoughtSpot Everywhere features available on ThoughtSpot Software clusters.

ThoughtSpot Software clusters now support ThoughtSpot Everywhere and Visual Embed SDK!

Starting from the 8.4.1-sw release, ThoughtSpot Software customers who have the license to embed ThoughtSpot can use ThoughtSpot Everywhere features and Visual Embed SDK to embed ThoughtSpot objects in their apps.

== Embedding methods

For information about embedding methods, see xref:embed-methods.adoc#_supported_embedding_methods[Supported embedding methods].


== Embedding support with Visual Embed SDK

The Visual Embed SDK provides Javascript-based embed packages and client libraries to embed and customize the following ThoughtSpot components in your web application: +

* ThoughtSpot Search
* Liveboards
* Full application

=== Supported SDK versions

The minimum SDK version required for embedding ThoughtSpot Software in your app is [version noBackground]#1.12.0#. You can upgrade to a later version if required. However, you must exercise caution before upgrading to a new version because the new versions may introduce breaking changes. Besides this, the new version may have APIs, methods, and attributes for features that are not yet available on your ThoughtSpot Software release.

For more information about the SDK versions, methods, and classes, see xref:api-changelog.adoc[Visual Embed Changelog] and link:{{visualEmbedSDKPrefix}}/modules.html[Visual Embed SDK Reference Guide, window=_blank].

== REST API

REST API v1 operations are supported on ThoughtSpot Software by default. You can make API calls to query data, add and modify ThoughtSpot objects, and perform administrative tasks.

The *Develop* tab in the UI also allows you to explore REST API v1 and REST API v2 [beta blueBackground]^BETA^ request and response workflows.

For a complete list of endpoints and information about allowed operations, see xref:rest-api-reference.adoc[REST API v1 Reference] and xref:rest-api-v2-reference.adoc[REST API v2 ^BETA^ Reference].
