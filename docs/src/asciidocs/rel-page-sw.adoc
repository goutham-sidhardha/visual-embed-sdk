:page-description: ThoughtSpot Everywhere release notes for ThoughtSpot Software releases.

This page provides information about new features and enhancements available for embedded ThoughtSpot instances.

== Version 9.0.0.sw, Coming soon

=== Advanced style customization

You can now override style specifications of the embedded UI pages and elements using custom CSS properties. Custom CSS provides granular control over the design elements and lets you modify the styles
to match the look and feel of your host application.

You can also preview the allowed style overrides in the Visual Embed Playground by selecting the *Apply custom styles* checkbox.

For more information, see xref:style-customization.adoc[Customize styles and layout] and xref:css-customization.adoc[Customize CSS].

=== New Liveboard experience

The xref:enable-liveboardv2.adoc[new Liveboard experience] is now Generally Available (GA) on embedded instances and is enabled by default.

=== REST API v2.0 endpoints and Playground

Starting with 9.0.0.sw, the REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ API endpoints are deprecated and removed from the REST API v2 Playground. A set of new endpoints are now generally available (GA) on all ThoughtSpot instances.

The new REST API v2.0 endpoints introduce several improvements to the request and response structure and let you perform more tasks in a single API call. For example, you can create a new user, map the user to groups and Orgs, set home Liveboards for the user, and assign privileges in a single API request.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* All REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ endpoints are deprecated, but remain functional until further notice. The REST API SDK that was available with REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ version is no longer supported. +
ThoughtSpot does not recommend using REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ endpoints for production use cases. For more information, see xref:deprecated-features.adoc#_deprecation_of_rest_v2_api[Deprecation announcements].
* The new REST API v2.0 endpoints are not an extension of the REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ endpoints. The resource categories, base path, endpoint URIs, and the structure of API requests and responses are different from those of the REST API v2 [beta betaBackground]^Beta^ version.
* Some API operations such as the CRUD operations for data connections and passing runtime filters on Liveboard visualizations are not available in the initial release. For more information, see xref:rest-api-v1v2-comparison.adoc[REST API v1 and v2.0 comparison] and xref:rest-api-v2-reference.adoc[REST API v2.0 reference].
====

=== Search bar embedding
You can now embed the ThoughtSpot search bar component in your app. For example, if you are using Google Sheets for data analysis, you can embed the ThoughtSpot search bar and let your users search data from a specific data source. The embedded Search bar allows passing search tokens and modifying search options. You can also retrieve the search results as raw data and let your host application render it in the format you want.

For more information, see xref:embed-searchbar.adoc[Embed ThoughtSpot search bar].

=== CSP allowlist for font, image and stylesheet sources

You can now enable CSP overrides for font, stylesheet, and image sources in ThoughtSpot UI. If you want to load fonts, stylesheets, images, or favicons from an external source, add the source URLs to the CSP allowlist on the *Security Settings* page.

For more information, see xref:security-settings.adoc#_add_trusted_domains_for_font_css_and_image_import[Security Settings].

=== Just-in-time user creation and dynamic privilege assignment

Starting from 8.9.0.cl, the xref:session-api.adoc#session-authToken[/tspublic/v1/session/auth/token] endpoint supports just-in-time provisioning of users. If the user specified in the API request does not exist in the ThoughtSpot system, you can set the `autocreate` property to `true` to add the user to ThoughtSpot and assign the user to `groups`.

=== Improvements to authentication methods and AuthType enums in the SDK

The following changes are introduced in the Visual Embed SDK to improve the authentication framework and options for embedded application users:

* New auth type enum for embedded SSO authentication
+
The `AuthType.EmbeddedSSO` enum allows you to enable SSO login on embedded instances. This authentication method allows you to use your current SAML IdP or OpenID Connect configuration and redirect users to the IdP for authentication within the embedded iFrame.

* Changes to the existing `AuthType` enums: +
** `AuthType.SAML` is renamed as `AuthType.SAMLRedirect` +
** `AuthType.OIDC` is renamed as `AuthType.OIDCRedirect` +
** `AuthType.AuthServer` is renamed to `AuthType.TrustedAuthToken` +

For more information, see xref:embed-authentication.adoc[Authentication].

=== Early access features

Starting from 9.0.0.sw, ThoughtSpot allows its administrators to turn on Early Access features from the Admin portal. Early Access features are qualified by ThoughSpot for customer use but are not enabled by default on ThoughtSpot instances until the features are GA.

The 9.0.0.sw release introduces the following Early Access features:

* Custom maps

=== REST API v1
The 9.0.0.sw release version introduces the following features and enhancements:

Session API::
The `/tspublic/v1/session/auth/token` endpoint includes the `autocreate` and `groups` properties to allow administrators to provision a user just in time (JIT) and assign privileges.

TML API::

* The TML objects retrieved from ThoughtSpot via `/tspublic/v1/metadata/tml/export` API endpoint show the object name as `liveboard` instead of `pinboard` in the API response.

* The `/tspublic/v1/metadata/tml/import` endpoint now supports re-using GUIDs for new objects created during the import if the `guid` in the imported TML is not being used by any other object on the server.

User API::
The `POST /tspublic/v1/user/` and `PUT /tspublic/v1/user/{userid}` API endpoints allow you to set the `triggeredbyadmin` flag to indicate if the user creation or update request is initiated by the ThoughtSpot admin or an external application.

Metadata API::

This release introduces the `POST /tspublic/v1/metadata/delete` endpoint, using which you can delete a metadata object.

== Version 8.8.1.sw, January 2023

ThoughtSpot 8.8.1.sw release version is now generally available!

The 8.8.1.sw release introduces the following new features and enhancements:

=== New Liveboard experience [beta betaBackground]^Beta^

This release introduces the new Liveboard experience [beta betaBackground]^Beta^  on ThoughtSpot instances. The new Liveboard experience is in Beta on embedded instances and is turned off by default.

The new Liveboard experience includes several new features and user-experience improvements to the *Liveboard* page:

Liveboard editing::
To edit a Liveboard, users must switch to the edit mode by clicking the *Edit* button on the Liveboard page.
The edit mode allows you to edit the Liveboard title and description text, apply filters, copy the Liveboard, modify the layout of the visualization tiles, delete a visualization, and so on.

Liveboard tabs::

The new Liveboard experience supports organizing visualizations in tabs. Users with edit access to a Liveboard can add, edit, and move visualizations to Tabs on a Liveboard. On embedded ThoughtSpot instances, developers can set a specific tab as an active tab using the Visual Embed SDK.
+
For more information, see xref:enable-liveboardv2.adoc#_customize_liveboard_tabs[Customize Liveboard tabs].

Custom tile size for visualizations on a Liveboard::

The new Liveboard experience allows you to customize the tile size of a visualization on a Liveboard. In the classic experience, ThoughtSpot allowed resizing visualizations using predefined layout options available in the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu]. With custom tile size, users can now change the size of a visualization just by clicking and dragging the tile to the desired size.

Liveboard filters::
* The Liveboard filter configuration options are available on a single modal.
* When a user creates a copy of a Liveboard, the filters applied to its visualizations are also copied.

Other features and enhancements::
* The *Add filters* action is placed in the primary menu bar and can be viewed only when a Liveboard is in edit mode. Only users with edit access to the Liveboard can apply filters.
* The *Undo*, *Redo*, and *Reset* actions for visualizations.
* The *Liveboard Info* action label in the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu is renamed to *Show Liveboard details*.
* The *Schedule* action is placed in the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu.
* Improved visualization Explore experience.

Deprecated features::
The following features are *_not_* available with the new Liveboard experience:
* The *Copy embed link* and *Copy link* menu actions in the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu of a Liveboard
* The edit title icon on visualization tiles
* The *Share* button on visualizations

+
For more information about the new Liveboard experience, see link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/liveboard-experience-new[New Liveboard experience, window=_blank].

Actions and Events in the SDK::
If you have enabled the new Liveboard experience on your instance, you can use the `Action` and `Event` enumeration members available in the SDK package to customize an embedded object and improve interactivity.

+
For example, to disable the *Delete* action for a visualization object on the Liveboard, you can use the `Action.Remove` enum. Similarly, you can trigger events such as  `VizPointClick`  on visualizations in an embedded Liveboard.

==== New Liveboard experience rollout on embedded instances

The new Liveboard experience [beta betaBackground]^Beta^  is turned off by default on embedded ThoughtSpot instances. If you are using the Visual Embed SDK to embed ThoughtSpot, you can xref:enable-liveboardv2.adoc[set the `liveboardV2` parameter] in the SDK package to `true` to enable the new experience globally for all users on your instance. +

[NOTE]
====
The Liveboard experience setting in the SDK takes precedence over the cluster-level settings in the *Admin* tab.
