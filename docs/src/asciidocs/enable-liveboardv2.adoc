:page-description: You can enable the new Liveboard experience on Liveboards embedded using the `LiveboardEmbed` or `AppEmbed` SDK library.

The new Liveboard experience in ThoughtSpot includes several new features and user-experience improvements. By default, the new Liveboard experience is disabled on embedded ThoughtSpot instances. Users with developer or administrator privileges can enable the new Liveboard experience at the cluster level and set it as the default experience for all users. Individual application users can also set the Liveboard experience preference on their profile settings page.

== Enable the new Liveboard experience for all users

You can enable the new Liveboard experience using one of the following options:

* Go to *Admin* > *Search & SpotIQ* and edit the Liveboard experience preference.
* Set the `liveboardV2` attribute in the SDK to `true`.
+
If the `liveboardv2` attribute is not set in the SDK, ThoughtSpot will use the Liveboard experience setting applied at the cluster level. If the new Liveboard experience is enabled in the SDK, it will take precedence over the setting applied at the cluster level in the `Admin` tab.

+
The following examples show how to enable the new Liveboard experience on a ThoughtSpot embedded application:

+
[source,javascript]
----
const liveboardEmbed = new LiveboardEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    liveboardV2: true,
});
----

+
[source,javascript]
----
const appEmbed = new AppEmbed(document.getElementById('ts-embed'), {
    frameParams: {
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
    },
    liveboardV2: true,
});
----

== Customize embedded Liveboards

The actions and menu options on the embedded Liveboard page vary based on the Liveboard experience setting.

Liveboard editing::

To edit a Liveboard, users must switch to the edit mode by clicking the *Edit* button on the Liveboard page. For example, to delete a visualization on a Liveboard, the user must click *Edit*, and then navigate to the *Delete* option on a visualization.

Filter application::

To apply filters, users must switch to the Liveboard edit mode. Only users with edit access to the Liveboard can apply filters.

+
The new experience also introduces the following enhancements to Liveboard filters:

* The link:https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/liveboard-filters[Liveboard filter configuration options, window=_blank] are available in a single modal.
* When a user creates a copy of a Liveboard, the filters applied to its visualizations are also copied.

Action enhancements::
* The *Add filters* action is placed on the primary menu bar and can be viewed only when a Liveboard is in edit mode.
* The *Undo*, *Redo*, and *Reset* buttons appear on visualizations when a user drills down to view specific data points on a visualization.
* The *Liveboard Info* action label in the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] is renamed to *Show Liveboard details*.
* The *Schedule* action is placed in the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu.
* The following actions are deprecated:
** The *Copy embed link* and *Copy link* menu actions in the More image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] menu of a Liveboard
** The edit title icon on visualization tiles
** The *Share* button on visualizations

=== Customize actions
You can use the `Action` enumeration members available in the SDK to customize an embedded Liveboard.

For example, to disable the *Delete* action for a visualization object on the Liveboard, you can use the `Action.Remove` enum.

For more information, see xref:embed-actions.adoc[Show or hide UI actions] and xref:embed-action-ref.adoc[Action Reference].

=== Trigger events

The embedded Liveboards support all host and embedded application events in the SDK irrespective of the Liveboard experience setting. For example, you can register and trigger events such as `VizPointClick` for visualizations on a Liveboard.

For information about events, see xref:embed-events.adoc[Events and app integration] and xref:events-ref.adoc[Events Reference].
