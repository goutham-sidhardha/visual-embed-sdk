:page-description: Use the REST Playground to explore the REST API and SDK.

The REST API Playground provides an interactive portal to explore REST v1 and v2 endpoints. To enable this feature on your cluster, contact ThoughtSpot Support.

If the REST API Playground and SDK [beta blueBackground]^BETA^ feature is enabled on your cluster, the Developer portal displays the *REST API* menu.

* To view the Playground with REST v1 endpoints, click **REST Playground v1**.

* To explore REST v2 endpoints and SDK, click **REST Playground v2**.

== REST API v1 Playground

The *REST Playground v1* opens the v1 API explorer and displays the available resource collections in the Swagger UI.  

To make an API call and view results:

. Click the API service category and view a list of endpoints.
. Click on the endpoint to which you want to send an API request.
. If required, define the attributes.
. Click **Try it out** and verify the API response and HTTP status code.
